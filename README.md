# Actor Movie Rating

## Description

PLEASE NOTE - This is a fork of the main project, as Cristan wasn't able to merge my changes done before the deadline as of now & I didn't want it not submitted. Links are below:
This repo - https://github.com/barrymoore1990/Project-two
Original repo - https://github.com/cristianmitu/Project-two
Published app - https://main--incomparable-frangipane-7189f4.netlify.app/

As a group, we decided to create an application where you can search for an actor, find their most known for movies, and submit a rating for that movie. This is because we have a love for movies and actors, but couldn't find a website which done similar, so we wanted to be able to do this easily. We learnt a huge amount, going from a very limited knowledge of react to a very good one
